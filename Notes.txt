To QUIT = contrl + C

Previous Error: What Went Wrong?
The build was previously hanging because you had multiple suspended (zsh: suspended) dotnet processes from pressing Ctrl+Z repeatedly.
These processes held onto resources and blocked new builds from running correctly.
Killing all those processes reset your terminal and allowed the build to proceed normally.
Best Practices to Avoid This in the Future
If a command is taking too long, use Ctrl+C to cancel it, not Ctrl+Z (which only suspends it).
If you ever see zsh: suspended again, check for stuck processes with ps aux | grep dotnet and kill them as you did.
Use dotnet clean between failed builds to clear intermediate files.

To Run: 
dotnet clean
dotnet build
dotnet run
GO TO => http://localhost:5098/swagger/index.html
Test it over there, by feeding inputs

DOCKER:
Go to temrminal: docker start oracle-xe and then try dotnet run (make sure docker is running and starts oracle-xe before loading backend project)
Oracle DB Check SQL:
docker exec -it oracle-xe bash
sqlplus system/MySecurePassword123@localhost:1521/XEPDB1
SELECT * FROM rooms; // Your SQL Query
exit // from SQL
exit // from bash
